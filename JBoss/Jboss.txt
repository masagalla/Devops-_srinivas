     domain 
     modules 
     welcome-content
     docs
     bin
     appclient 



 How can we start it 

     go to the home folder of the wildfly than Bin folder 
           file name :standalone 
     once start the windows batchfile it will show console 

how to shutdown the wildfly in windows ?




How to create Management control user 

         <home folder of wildFly>-->bin
         file name :add-user(windows batch file)
         
 once you run add users .batch file 
asking what type of user do you wish to add

    a) management-user (mgmt-user.properties)
    b) Application-user (application-user.properties)


  if we click on username it will ask to type re-type password 


How to Access WildFly
---------------------

  admin/management console:<URL:9990>
  username / password 


one of the Folder in folder structure is standalone 
where will be having the configuration, deployment and logs 


  standalone -->config, deployment, logs 

 configuration: where we will be having configuration of applications, user specific
         example: mgmt-uers.poperties 
                  mgmt-groups.properties 

Logs: standalone -->log-->logs of the wildfly 

Deployments : A deployment represents anything that can be deployed 

     example: An Application such as EJB-JAR, WAR,EAR any kind of standalone archive such as RAR or Jboss-specific deployed into a server 

     you can use drag and drop to add new content or replace existing deployments simply drag one or several files onto the deployment will be added .
    the deployments added by drag and drop will be enabled by default .

    left side you will see the '+' symbol click on it than it will shows 
                              --> upload deployment 
                              --> un managed deployment
                              --> create empty deployment 


how to deploy the application or Artifact 
-----------------------------------------

  1---> copying the war file and pasting it deployment folder of wildfly (home of wildfly-->standalone-->deployments)
  2---> cp<artifacts source path><destination of deployments of wildfly>
  3---> Jboss wildfly GUI --> upload artifact 
 

   How can we change default -port no.of wildfly 
                   -mamt console and Application port.no ?

   how we can configure master-slave architecture in wildfly ?


   Configuration Changes
-------------------------

  things to keep in mind before changing configurational changes 

   1. where to change 
   2. backup
   3. how to change 
   4. Try or experiment in local environment 
   5. Documentation 
    
       
snapshot/Backup 

  for wildfly configuration 
     --> home folder of wildfly -->standalone-->configuration-->stanadalone_xml_history
        file name: standalone.v1
      standalone_portcange.v2

need to rename the original or existed file and replace the customized as per requirement/change 


## Different states types of artifacts deployed in wldfly
----------------------------------------------------------

  in wildfly ,deployed artifacts can have various status states including
       
        "deployed"
        "undeployed"
        "failed"
        "disabled "
        "suspended"

deployed 
      
      the Application is successfully running on the wildfly server and accessible to users 

undeployed

      the application has been removed from the server and is not currently running 

Failed
        
      the deployment process encountered an error and the application is not running 


disabled 
      
      The Application is intentionally stopped administrator and cannot be accessed until enabled 

suspended 

      the Application is temporarily paused  and can be resumed later 

Redeployed 

      The application is temporarily being updated with new code and is not fully available while the redeployed process is ongoing 


Accessing deployment status 
----------------------------

wildfly management console :

    you can view the status of deployed artifacts through the wildfly admin console ,
    which provides a list of deployment with their current state  
  
CLI(Command line interface )

     using the wildfly command -line interface ,you can query the state of deployments with management commands 


indicating whether the application is currently running not deployed encountered an error during deployment intentionally deactivated ,
temporarily paused or is in the process of being re-deployed with updates 


Domain & Host controller in Wildfly 
-----------------------------------
in jboss wildfly , a "domain controller " is the central management point for a group of servers within a domain ,responsible for maintain 
overall configuration and policy .

while a "host controller " is a separate process running on each server within the domain communicating with the domain controller to manage the individual server instances on the host machine 

Essentially ,the domain controller dictates the overall configuration ,and the host controllers execute those configuration on their respective servers 


key Points about domain and host controller
-----------------------------------------

Domain controller:
-----------------

--> Acts as the cetrall management point for the entire domain 
--> Stores the domain -wide configuration in a life called "domain.xml"   
     (Home Folder-->Domain-->Configuration-->Domain.xml)
--> Responsible for distributing configuration changes to all host controllers within the Domain 


Host Controller:
-----------------

--> manage the application the server instances running on a specific host 
--> read its configuration from a "host.xml" file Specific to that host 
      (Home folder-->domain-->configuration-->host.xml)
--> communication within the domain controller to receive configuration updates and starts/stop server instances 


Domain is referring to centralized or master where we can manage other wildfily servers (other means host)
