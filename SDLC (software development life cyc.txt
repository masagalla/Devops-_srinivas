SDLC (software development life cycle )
----
why Devops ?
---------

1.Traditional Waterfall model
------------------------------

Requirement & gathering Analysis
          |
       Design
          |
       implements
          |
        Test
          |
       Deploy
          |
      Maintenance 

2 .What is Agile Methodology 
-----------------------------

  @ In this Agile methodology each project is broken 
    up into several "iterations"
  @ all the iterations should be duration (between 2 to 8 weeks )
  @ At the end of each iteration a working product should be Delivered 

    1st iteration -----> 2nd Iteration----> 3rd iteration

# Limitations of Agile 
-------------------------

    @ Develop team [wants to Change]
     
       (code works fine in my Laptop)
 
    @ Operation Team [wants to Stability]
        
      (there is some problem with code it does not working in production )

 ## DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT DEVOPS CULTURE 

  --> Release and Deploy mismatch 
  --> unpredictable issues 
  --> blame game 
  --> lack of monitoring 

## DEVOLOPMENT WITH DEVOPS CULTURE 

  --> Streamed delivers 
  --> Team work i collaboration 
  --> continuous monitoring and feedback 

## WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ?

   @ For Developers 

      (use system with little or no waiting time )   
   
   @ for operations 

     --> system should be up and running most of the time 
     --> system required for easy administration 
     --> effective monitoring feedback system should be established 
 

## WHAT EXACTLY IS DEVOPS IN REAL LIFE 

    
           plan
             |
           code 
             |
           build
             |
            test
             |
           Release 
             |
           deploy
             |
           operation
             |
           monitoring

## WHAT DEVOPS  IS NOT 
  
   --> Devops is not a role ,person or organization 
   --> devops is not a separate team 
   --> Devops is not a Production or tool 
   --> Devops is not about just writing Scripts or implementing tools             
 
          
## WHAT IS DEVOPS
-------------------
 
   Devops is practice that allows a single team to manage the entire 
   application development life cycle , that is development, testing ,deployment ,and monitoring,

## WHAT DOES DEVOPS DO 
----------------------

  --> Integrate developers and operations 
  --> improves collaboration and productivity 
  --> Automation Infrastructure 
  --> Automating workflows 
  --> continuously measuring application Performance 



## SKILLS OF A DEVOPS ENGINEER 
-------------------------------

  @ SKILLS 
     
      ## TOOLS

     --> Version control - GIT
     --> Continuous integration -JENKINS
     --> virtualization/containerization - DOCKER/KUBERNATES 
     --> Configure management - Puppet/Ansible 
     --> monitoring - Nagios  
        
     ## network skills 
      --> general networking skills - establishing connection between the continuous / port forwarding/container orchestration  
      
      ## other Skills 

        --> people skill  
        --> process skills 
        --> customer skill and empathy 
        --> cloud Awareness
