      apache tomcat folder structure
 
  --> conf = stores tomcats configuration files 

  --> logs = stores the log files related to tomcat operations 
 
  --> webapps = The default deployment directory for web applications.
 
  --> work = stores compiled JSP files and servlet-generated code 
 
  --> bin = it contains scripts and executable files to start and stop tomcat 
 
  --> temp = used by tomcat to store temporary files such as extracted.war files 


          how to Access an Application
         ------------------------------
   
     URL Of the tomcat (127.0.0.1:8080 (or) localhost:8080)/aja  [where aja is Artifact]


      The command to get the project 
      --------------------------------

   mvn Archetype:generate -Dgroupid=com.example.aja -Dartifactid=Aja-DarchetypeArtifactid=maven -archetype -webapp -Dinteractivemode =false 


      ## how can we place the artifact from maven project of target folder to Apache tomcat web-app folder 
                 
             " cp<pathwhereartifact><pathwherewebappsoftomcat>
               cp<source><destination>
               <>destination>cp<source>  

     configuration changes
    -------------------------

    we need to restart the servers.

          [ To change the port no.of the apchache tomcat we should stop the tomacat than change the default port no to other port no than we can start.]
   

   --> To deploy the application in another way is by using tomacat GUI(graphical user interface )

        Access the URL of tomcat then search for the .war file to deploy 
                    
         [click on the choose file it will open dialogue box in dialogue box we need to select the artifact and
          click on the open then we need to click on deploy button] 


          how can we access apache tomcat GUI 
        
          Go to tomcat home folder 
         
           home folder of Apache tomcat--->conf
           modify " tomcat -user.xml"(using text editor eg:vi)
            vi tomcat-user.xml
           we need to search for 
                |
           go to below line 
          <user username ="admin" 
          need uncomment those lines[ "!--" and "-->"]
          once we modify tomcat-user.xml file save and quit
